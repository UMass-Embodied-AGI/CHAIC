base,,"You are $AGENT_NAME$. A human $OPPO_NAME$ is $CONSTRAINT$. Your goal is to help $OPPO_NAME$ transport all furnitures to $GOAL_POSITION$.

Note that:
- $OPPO_NAME$ is less capable of lifting heavy objects than you are, and certain furnitures may be too heavy for both you and $OPPO_NAME$ to carry.
- You and $OPPO_NAME$ can carry the same furniture together.
- All furnitures are identified by a unique name and ID, e.g. <table> (712). 
- Actions cost several steps, and the maximum number of steps you can take is 1500. It may be costly to walk for long distance, so you need to transport furnitures to the goal place as early as possible.
- The reward is proportional to the weight of the furniture, so you should try to carry furniture that looks heavier first.
